# Personal Portfolio Repository v1

## Introduction
This repository hosts the very first portfolio in my life as a sodtware engineer. The objective was to

merely showcase my basic skills as a software engineer and as a 3D modeler and ...artist? Yeah. Artist.
 
The project has been made with React-Three-Fiber and Tailwind for the styling.
The build tool used is the now very famous Vite.
